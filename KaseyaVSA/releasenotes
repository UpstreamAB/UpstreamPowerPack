UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK MSP NOTES 2018-05-04 (Vegas 2018)

Once again we are Power Packing (last time we use that lame joke, we promise) our bags for Las Vegas and Kaseya Connect 2018. Hope to see many of you there. Biggest news this time around is our Chocolatey Agent Procedures. If you are unfamiliar with Cholcolatey, think of it like  Debian “apt-get” for Windows. Done right it can save a LOT of time deploying and updating applications. Take it for a test run.

Oh, we made a final name change to “Upstream Kaseya Power Pack MSP”. This better describes what Power Pack is all about. A free framework for setting up and maintaining a MSP business with Kaseya VSA in a hearbeat. Any other non MSP business can of course use the content if they want to. We also made a whole new set of Kaseya Policies to give you some BASIC and PREMIUM Managed Services offerings example. Upates and name changes to Views, Reports and Monitor Sets to fully reflect the Policies were also made.

KASEYA AGENT PROCEDURES 2018-05-04

NEW: Spring cleaning in the Agent Procedures structure with better overview of the content. Please give us feedback on this.

NEW: New Folder under Windows called “Chocolatey Application Management Automation”. A lot of application deployment, upgrade and removal examples with the poular Chocolatey framework.

NEW: New Folder called “Other MSP Vendors Partners”. Agent Procedurers to be used in collaboration with other vendors in the MSP/RMM space. Auvik, IT Glue and RapidfireTools are the first. Still under developent, but better to share right away. Please give feedback on tools you woul like to see here.

UPDATED: Windows, MS Office And Office 365 Specific, Application Removal, Remove Application – Windows – Remove Office 2003/2007/2010/2013/2016. We now pull the VBS code directly from Github.

KASEYA POLICIES 2018-05-04

A new setup of Polices for a BASIC and PREMIUM Managed Services offering. The idea is to apply BASIC on all agents. No automation, but stuff that all customers should have. Then gradually add more automation in the PREMIUM tier where you focus on actual management.

MONITOR SETS 2018-05-04

Name changes on Monitor Sets to reflect the BASIC and PREMIUM tiers above.

---------------------------------------------

UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK BASIC NOTES 2018-03-07 (Snow B Gone!)

Latest cumulative update to Windows 10 version 1709 gave us all a surprise. No longer can Kaseya VSA (or any other RMM tool for that matter) control the Windows Update exclusively. This means Windows may patch whenever it pleases. We at Upstream actually recommend MSP’s to rethink management, packaging and offerings when it comes to Windows 10 (and Office 365). The rules of apply, schedule and control are no longer possible to maintain. Instead, focus on going with the flow, validate and keep the end user experience as smooth as possible. This is why we created two new Agent Procedures sub folder dedicated specifically to Windows 10 and Office 365. First out in this new setup is Agent Procedures focusing on Windows 10 patch management. And as usual we have updated all our app deploy and update Agent Procedures to latest version. Enjoy!

UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK BASIC NOTES 2017-12-05 (X-mas 2017)

The Apple root bug has chocked by it’s simplicity. Be sure to patch your MAC machines. We provide some tools for that. Intel are in the doghouse together with Apple. Be sure to be proactive on any forthcoming Intel chiset updates by running the “Security – Windows – Scan for Intel Mgmnt Engine Vulnerability” Agent Procedure in combination with the report “Security – Windows – Scan For Intel Mgmnt Vulnerability”. As usual with Power Pack, the most common applications are updated to latest. We also invested in some deeper Office 2003/2007/2010 removal tools. Good to use when migrating to Offcie 365.

UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK BASIC NOTES 2017-06-22 (Midsummer Edition)

As usual, all of Sweden will be shut down celebrating midsummer on Friday. Saturday and Sunday will be in recovery and bootup mode. We managed to get some updates out the door and ready for delivery. Worth mentioning is the Agent Procedure for fixing the Windows Update Cache. We have on-boarded many Kaseya customers previously running other RMM tools over the years and we sometimes see issues with Kaseya Patch Management not getting the the privileges to do its magic. This due to stuff left behind from prior Patch Management solutions and can be fixed by resetting the whole Patch Cache on the machine. This is something we now share with all of you.

We also made a new NSA/WannaCry Patch Procedure as even more patches for 2003, 2008, XP, Vista and Windows 8.0 got released last week. This time it’s not just SMB but Windows Search Service that is affected. Better to be prepared for the next wave of WannaCry, right?

Please, please please: Schedule recurring Patch Managment on ALL of your Windows Machines!

As usual we try to stay as current as possible with all the Application Deployment and Update examples, but feel free to contact us if you find any application lagging behind. That’s all for now. Have a great Weekend!

KASEYA AGENT PROCEDURES 2017-06-22

NEW: Sys Mgmnt –  Windows – Reset Windows Update Cache. This will help you troubleshooting any Patch Management issues where patches won’t get applied by automation. It’s also good to use as a standard procedure when on-boarding new customers.

NEW: Security – Windows – Patch NSA WannaCry Vulnerabilities Server 2003 (Unitl June 2017). Yes, even more patches to apply. We made an effort to catch them all in one single Agent Procedure, throwing them at the wall and see if they stick. Do try this out and give us feedback. You can also use the Server 2003 template to patch 2008.

NEW: Security – Windows – Patch NSA WannaCry Vulnerability On XP (Until June 2017) Same as above. Yes, even more patches to apply. We made an effort to catch them all in one single Agent Procedure, throwing them at the wall and see if they stick. We focused on the Scandinavian languages and US English, but feel free to add any additional language. Do try this out and give us feedback. You can also create automation from the XP template to patch Windows Vista and Windows 8.0 if you still have any.

NEW: Sys Mgmnt – Windows – Add SQL Tcp Port 1433 Allowed Firewall rule Example. This will help you setting Windows Firewall rules on Serves and Workstations.

NEW: User Experience – Windows – Pin Outlook Word Excel 2016 On Taskbar. This example will pin Outlook, Word and Excel on the taskbar, as the name implies. Use it for standardization or in a help-desk call.

The focus for this release is Windows 10 and some cool management for that specific OS. Do try the new Agent Procedures for removing modern apps and more. A good way to clean the initial installation from unwanted bloatware. We will spend more time on tweaking Windows 10 in coming releases.

The Badlock bug was more hype than hurt. We did spend some pro-active thinking on how to audit SMB servers, as that was the potential attack surface. As i turned out, this was not the problem at all. Anyhow, we learned a lot and you get the Powershell scripts needed to audit SMB connections and session on Windows 2012 servers. It may be of use to you anyhow.

As usual, Agent Procedures for Java8, Adobe Reader, Adobe Air, Firefox, Chrome and many more are at the latest version available in our Agent Deploy and Update section.

---------------------------------------------

UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK NOTES 2016-02-19

We have tweaked the Audit, Internal and External report sets. The idea of the 3 sets is a smooth workflow. The Audit report set is for pre-sales and client prospecting. The Internal report set is for getting the proper KPI’s and performance metrics on you and your services, not the end client. The External report set is to show and prove you value to your end customers. We call this the GOLD offering in this sample set. We also introduce a new concept of hashtagging the deploy and upgrade Agent Procedures for tracking purposes. You can see the end resultd on page 9 in the External report. Keep in mind, the report sets is depending on some Custom Fields (from our Power Pack) and they have to be adjusted on your system. Chances are that you have other Custom filed numbers in your database. As usual, Java8, Adobe Reader, Adobe Air and more Agent Procedures are the latest version available.

Previously when executing the Java 8 32 bit EXE installer on a 64 bit Windows system we need to run as current user with local Admin rights. Not very secure. This is a limitation within the Java 8 32bit EXE installer package, not Kaseya. Running the MSI package with ”MSIEXEC /I” solves this issue, but Oracle does not provide MSI packages to be download without a Oracle Java SE Advanced Agreement. You can ”bake” your own MSI installer by following this link, but that is time consuming and impratical for most. To be able to provide the ”Import, click & Run” feature we strive for with our Agent Procedures, we turn to friends on Sourceforge.

UPDATED: Application Update – Windows – Java 8 32bit – Update To Latest 8: Same changes as above but only updates to latest if Java 8 32Bit already exists.

UPDATED: Application Update – Windows – Java 7 – Update Any 7 32/64Bit To Latest 8 32Bit: This is a good clean-up Agent Procedure for onboarding a client. Same changes as above but only updates to latest Java 8 32Bit if any Java 7 32/64Bit already exists. Any previous and older Java 7 32/64Bit or Java 8 32/64Bit will be removed in the process.

UPDATED: Custom Field – Audit – Windows – Get LENOVO Workstation Warranty: Get the warranty status on LENONVO workstations based on serial number. This is a perfect example how to use existing VB scripts to pull back the returned information to a custom field in Kaseya. Added error detection if warranty query is only partial.

NEW: Custom Field – Audit – Windows – Get DELL Workstation Warranty: The latest warranty audit Procedure in addition to HP and LENOVO. Get the warranty status on DELL workstations based on serial number. This is a perfect example how to use existing VB scripts to pull back the returned information to a custom field in Kaseya. DISCLAIMER 1: A big thank you from Upstream to one of our customers Jonas Haggren @Crossnet for finding the DELL warrany VB script. DISCLAIMER 2: We take absolutely no credit for the awesome VB script used here. The script is run as-is without any modification. Please check out the author’s blog.

NEW: Sys Mgmnt – Windows – Restart Stopped Auto Services Except Blacklisted: Some Services marked Auto will be stopped by default. SPPSVC Service is a good example. This is by design. This WMIC based example will audit auto services with status stopped but ignore a blacklist. After auditing is complete a restart attempt followed by a final audit for verification will be executed. All this presented in the Kaseya Proecedure Log. You can add more services you would like to ignore in a static “blacklist” variable.

NEW: Application Deployment – Windows – Java 8 32Bit – Deploy Or Force Update To Latest: As Java 7 is about to get retired for good and no more updates are released we figured it’s about time to migrate to Java 8. We cracked the nut when deploying 32Bit Java 8 on a 64Bit system without the complicated “extraxt MSI file” fuzz. Read more how we did it in the commentary lines in the Procedure. Just click and run, as you expect from Upstream Kaseya Power Pack.

NEW: Application Update – Windows – Java 8 32Bit – Update To Latest 8: In addition to the Procedure above we made a Java 8 update Procedure. It will only affect machines already installed with Java 8. Please note that since Java 8 Update 20 a silent install will not remove any previous Java 8 version. We solved this by calling for uninstall before deploying the latest version (update 45 when writing this) keeping the version to only one, the latest.

NEW: Application Update – Windows – Java 7 – Update Any 7 32/64Bit To Latest 8 32Bit: Force any Java 7 version (32 or 64Bit) to get updated to latest Java 8 32Bit (update 45 when writing this) and remove any older Java 7 or 8 intances.

NEW: Sys Mgmnt – Windows – Sysinternals Sysmon – Install Service: Installs Sysmon as a service. Read more about Sysinternals Sysmon here. Baically it extends the application process logging. Great for troubleshooting.

NEW: Sys Mgmnt – Windows – Sysinternals Sysmon – Remove Service: Removes Sysmon as a service.
