In order to successfully execute the Agent Procedures in "Extended Audit Procedures - Custom Fields Required" you need to create the following Custom Fields under Audit, System Information, New Custom Field (press the add symbol).

Note from the coach: We @Upstream use the prefix "CF" before any created Custom Field. It's a good rule giving the list of Custom Fields a clear and crisp naming standard.
