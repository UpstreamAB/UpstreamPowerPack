# Who are you guys?

Upstream is the exclusive Kaseya partner and distributor for the Scandinavian market since 2006. Our main focus is to service MSP’s (Managed Service Providers), but we also help Retail and Enterprise IT customers. We market, sell and implement Kaseya (an many other MSP best of breed solutions) with focus on a business oriented outcome, not just the technical stuff.

# Why do you do this?

Upstream Kaseya VSA Power Pack is our gift back to the global Kaseya Community. We live and breathe IT-automation. Over the years we have created a lot of cool automated solutions with Kaseya that most of our Kaseya customers, both MSP’s, Retailers and Enterprises use daily. We believe our content can be of use to all Kaseya admins globally. The potential to automate and do more with less effort is limitless, but sometimes it can be difficult to get started. This we understand. Upstream Kaseya Power Pack helps you to get you get going with the basics, as the name. We hope to inspire you to do more really cool automation.

# Is Upstream Kaseya VSA Power Pack really for free?

Yes! Free to be used by anyone, but only supported within our Upstream Premium customer support. You can use it and bruise it. Go nuts. Existing Upstream Premium customers in Scandinavia running Kaseya will get support implementing and maintaining Upstream Kaseya Power Pack.

# So, how do I get it?

Importing the Upstream Kaseya Power Pack from GitHub to Kaseya VSA (both SaaS and on-premises) is easy. Download our complete project ZIP file, extract and import the various XML files from the “System, Import Center” tab in Kaseya. You will figure out what is what based on the naming standard. Look for “UPSTREAM KASEYA POWER PACK” in shared folders under the tabs Monitor, Views, Agent Procedures, Info Center and more. read more on our GitHub wiki.

# ...and how do I update the content?

Upstream Kaseya VSA Power Pack is meant to be used for best practices, inspiration and education. Importing a new release will not update all of your currently imported and applied content out of the box. That would be horrible. With every release you will get a new folder with the respective release date. Some stuff will be added, some stuff will be updated (like App updates), some stuff will be static and the same as last release. It’s all in the release notes. Pick and choose what you think is cool and apply it to your own awesome automation.

# Enjoy!

Kind Regards, The Upstream Team
